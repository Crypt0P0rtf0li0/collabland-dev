Collab.Land is proud to announce the launch of its new Developer Portal and API product offering. These pivotal additions serve to broaden accessibility for developers, paving the way for further innovation within the comprehensive Collab.Land network of communities.

## Introducing the Developer Portal
The Developer Portal provides a dedicated platform for developers to contribute their Miniapps to the Collab.Land Miniapp Marketplace. This significant evolution enables developers to reach over 50,000 communities who are actively seeking to enhance their members' experiences. Through the portal, community leaders gain access to a vast array of applications and services to customize their communities.

## First Look at Collab.Land APIs
For the first time, the Developer Portal offers developers access to Collab.Land's APIs. These APIs encourage direct interaction with Collab.Land's network, facilitating a seamless integration process for active members across various websites, platforms, or apps.

## Tiered API Product Offering

Designed with diverse needs in mind, Collab.Land's API product is available in three tiers:

**Free Tier**: Ideal for newcomers to the API, offering limited requests and rate limits for initial experimentation and familiarization.

**Pro Tier**: Geared towards developers requiring higher request and rate limits. This tier covers most use cases, perfectly suited for those ready to incorporate the API into larger projects.

**Enterprise Tier**: Customized to suit specific requirements, the Enterprise Plan is for brands or projects that need custom support or integrations demanding additional resources from the core team. For those interested in this plan, please direct all inquiries to the Collab.Land team.

## Upholding Privacy and User Consent
Collab.Land remains committed to privacy and security. Accordingly, any use of the community APIs that involves member data will necessitate explicit user consent, reflecting best practices in data privacy and giving members complete control over their personal information.

## Empowering the Web3 Journey
Collab.Land is dedicated to empowering multiple personas on their journey through web3. By offering developers more extensive access and powerful tools, Collab.Land is fostering innovation and promoting accessibility within its network. Simultaneously, it stays true to its commitment to safety and privacy.
The launch of the Developer Portal and new API product signifies a significant milestone in Collab.Land's ongoing mission to create a more interactive, personalized, and secure digital ecosystem.
