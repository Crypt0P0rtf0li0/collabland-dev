</div>

1. Log into the Discord server where you would like to disconnect your wallet from.
2. Click the “Let’s Go!” button in the collabland-join channel.
3. Click your connected wallet.
4. Click the "Disconnect" button that is now available.
5. Confirm that you want to disconnect your wallet.
6. Your wallet is now disconnected.

Disconnecting a wallet now disconnects it from _all_ communities. The wallet will disconnect from every other server.

It's important to note that disconnecting your wallet will result in the loss of all roles associated with that wallet for all communities. So, before proceeding with the disconnection process, please ensure that you understand the consequences of this action
