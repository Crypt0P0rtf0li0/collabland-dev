If you wish to disconnect your wallet from all current communities, you can do so by following a few simple steps:

<div class="text--center">
  <img  src={img1} alt="Wallet Disconnect" />
</div>

1. Log into a Discord server where you would like to disconnect your wallet from.
2. Click the “Let’s Go!” button in your server's `#collabland-join` channel.
3. Click through the bot prompts to the connect.collab.land website.
4. Select a wallet to disconnect.
5. Click the "Disconnect" button that is now available.
6. Confirm that you want to disconnect your wallet.
7. Your wallet is now disconnected from _all_ communities. You will lose all roles and access associated with that wallet.

:::caution

**_Disconnecting your wallet will result in the loss of all roles associated with that wallet for all communities_** because it disconnects from _all_ communities. The wallet will disconnect from _every_ community you used it in and you will lose _all_ roles and access associated with that wallet.
