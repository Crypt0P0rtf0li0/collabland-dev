## Browse & Install apps

Community administrators can see a comprehensive list of all the apps available in the Collab.Land Marketplace within the [Command Center](https://cc.collab.land). The displayed apps contain useful information such as the title, icon, brief description, rating, cost and category (bot command or CC extension).

Admins can search for a specific app using its name, or filter the available options. Additionally, admins can sort the apps by their alphabetical order, date added, and price.

To install an app, an administrator clicks the "Install" button. A window appears displaying the price of the app and the available balance or indicating if it's a "Free Install". Upon completion of the installation, the install button will change to uninstall, and the app will be ready to use.
