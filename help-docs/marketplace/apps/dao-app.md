## The DAO App

### About this app

The DAO App gives your community the ultimate, automated, and customizable transparency dashboard of critical community information all in one-single, easy to use interface.

The DAO App is designed to decrease the workload of your admins, reduce your costs, and reduce general questions by your members while simultaneously increasing community participation, increasing member retention, increasing community transparency and more.

Included with the transparency dashboard are: treasury details, transaction history with labeling, proposal details, member voting participation rates, wallet holder details, whale activity, and more.

### Getting Started

1. Community admins install The DAO App Miniapp from the [Collab.Land Marketplace](https://cc.collab.land/).

2. Reach out to us [via our Discord server](https://discord.gg/QQAJX9Xz) to get your community set up on The DAO App.

3. After setup, this one single command `/community` provides your community with everything they need in order to find out what they want to know. The DAO App aggregates data from Snapshot, other on-chain ledgers, and can also optionally integrate with your communitiesâ€™ native website for ultimate transparency and accessibility.
