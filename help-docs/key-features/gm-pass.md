# gmPASS

gmPASS is a Programmable Key Pair (PKP), a non-custodial web3 identity. This versatile tool leverages the principles of multi-party computation to offer several key functionalities in the web3 space.

As a PKP, gmPASS can provide users of web3 with seamless ”seed-phraseless" onboarding experiences and facilitate transaction execution on blockchains.

Notably, as a PKP, gmPASS has the following features:
1. It is blockchain agnostic, meaning it can be used to sign transactions on any blockchains using ECDSA for digital signatures.
2. It is programmable and contains application logic that it should follow, allowing for functionalities like defining signing automations.
3. It is fault-tolerant, meaning it is generated collectively by Collab.Land’s Lit nodes through a process called Distributed Key Generation (DKG). This allows Collab.Land to generate a new key-pair where the private key never exists in its entirety.
