# Background check

The background balance check is a feature that is enabled by default on Collab.Land to ensure that all users holding certain roles in a community continue to meet the token requirement. If a user is found to no longer have the required tokens to meet the criteria specified by the TGR rules, their role will be automatically revoked.

<!---

# After the initial verification, there are two ways background check happens.

# 1. Blockchain event listener: Responds within 1-2 hours of when token is sold or otherwise transferred (Mainnet and Flow only).

--->

After the initial verification, Background check every 24 hours. This is applicable to all chains.

Note: If the background check is disabled, then the bot is not able to revoke any roles if a member no longer holds the required tokens. The only way to revoke a role is for the member to verify again their wallet in that community.
