# Node Red

*** Node Red is being deprecated

Node red was a drag and drop interface that recieved requests from discord, handled error responses locally, and forwarded requests to the job server when necesary.

In V2 node red will be gone, requests will go straight to the API or JOBS service and all interactions will be handled through MONOREPO

Be ready for monorepo interface which will enable developers to quickly iterate and support multiple interfaces including Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, etc.
