# Collab.Land Connect

```bash
git clone git@github.com:abridged/collabland-connect.git
cd collabland-connect
npm install
```

** TODO

Project has a readme. Some of the key points are build and start

Can override the port so it starts on a different port. Important if you have multiple projects running

Important to do the new EVM chain path because it is a goal not just documentation on a bunch of code bases.
