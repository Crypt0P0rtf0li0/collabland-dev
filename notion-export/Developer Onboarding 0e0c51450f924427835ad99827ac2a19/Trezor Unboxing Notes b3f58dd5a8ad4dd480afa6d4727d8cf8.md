# Trezor Unboxing Notes

Caleb got a Trezor Model T on 2/21/22

# Initial Thoughts

1. Why is there an SD slot in the side of the Trezor
2. How do I interact with the Trezor if there are no buttons - touch screen?
3. I personally like the form factor of Ledger better. But I haven’t used the Touch screen so maybe it is better...
4. Touch screen is really nice
5. Scrolling through list of recovery words is really nice on screen
6. Setting pin on touch screen is cool.  The fact that the keypad of numbers rearanges itself was really confusing at first but makes sense so no one can easily guess your pin based on finger placement
7. Hold to verify was cool
8. Not sure why it says “are you really sure you want to set a pin. I would guess everyone SHOULD set at a pin.  maybe it’s simply more of a warning but still intended for you to set it up.
