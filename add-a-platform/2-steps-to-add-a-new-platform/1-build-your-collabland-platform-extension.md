# Build Your Collab.Land Platform Extension

![Overview diagram](./images/overview.png)

[Collab.Land](http://Collab.Land) provides solutions for bringing web2 users to web3. From web2, we now support platforms such as Discord, Telegram, and so on Reddit, Github, and Notion. To web3, we support the most of popular chains. Meanwhile, we are proactively decentralizing Collab.Land. We are also working with many different partners to build web3 network together.

To help build a decentralized network, we’d love to see more platforms connecting to web3 no matter it is a social media platform, a workspace, or a payment platform. If you’re interested in implementing an extension to join web3 with our infrastructure, our architecture allows you to build a pluggable extension with us easily.
