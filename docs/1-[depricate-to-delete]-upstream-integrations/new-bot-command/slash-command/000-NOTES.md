ALOK

I copied the contents of rodrigos "onboarding" into the folders I created for slash command
I think that "0-onboarding, 1-build-the-backend, and 2-discord" should be common to all projects
Same with how to start the job server and SQSD and backend, however those may be diff for wallets if you have
diff envrionmental variable setups

I made it a folder structure so we could nest or maybe reference other files in the folders index.md
if the file is a reference.
