## What is Collab.Land?

Collab.Land is a decentralized community platform that allows communities to create and manage their own governance systems. It is a community-owned and operated platform that is governed by its community members.

## How does Collab.Land work?

Collab.Land provides a bot that you can install to help manage access, roles and permissions in your tokenized communities. The Collab.Land bot will join your community on (Discord, Telegram, and Reddit) and grant members access to the community based on the rules you set up.

## How to use Collab.Land bot?

- Install the Collab.Land bot on your community platform.
