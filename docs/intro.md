# Introduction

**Come Join us at Collab.Land**

Partner Contributor Program

**Who we are:** 
This summer Collab.Land will decentralize ownership of the Collab.Land project before moving to fully decentralized governance through the Collab.Land DAO.

**Our Mission:**
To create community tools that enhance collaboration amongst human beings of all races, ethnicities, nationalities, genders, religions, abilities & beliefs by aligning incentives for a positive sum outcome.

**Our Vision:**
Open-source digital networks self-governing to become online institutions, owned & operated by the members of these communities.  As a result, these communities begin working together for a better outcome for all creating a new form of digital democracy that evolves to enhance human collaboration.

**Our Project:**
Collab.Land is open-sourcing web3 community tools & decentralizing the governance of itself to a network of contributors, members, and partners. The Collab.Land DAO will work toward creating a mutually aligned model for the operator & user to share incentives. The Collab.Land DAO will prioritize product choices based on the DAO governance. By doing this we will generate better products catered to the requests of the community. As the Collab.Land product demand rises its token utilities & yields become in greater demand, driving the value of the Collab.Land token.

**Our Invitation:**
Collab.Land is extending an offer to you to join us in building the network we all want. We are bringing together web3 partners working on a wide variety of projects to build with each other & on top of each other's tools to shape the next generation of what a network could be.  We would like your help in creating the largest open collaborative project in the world.

By holding a Collab.Land Patron NFT you are now able to access the Collab.Land tool kit to make proposals & start building with us. In the following instructions we will outline what is needed to get started.
