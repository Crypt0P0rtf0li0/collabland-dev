# Extending Collab.Land

In this section, you'll learn all you need to know to extend Collab.Land with your custom integrations and build Miniapps for the Collab.Land ecosystem and [Marketplace](../intro#the-miniapp-marketplace).

<!-- ## Add new Discord bot commands

## Add new wallet connections

## Connect to a new blockchain

## Introduce a new governing asset -->

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

#### Ongoing Development + Documentation

- Write documentation for your Miniapp
  1. Miniapp install documentation, hosted in [Marketplace](https://cc.collab.land/)
  2. Miniapp usage/tutorial documentation, hosted at [Admin help docs](https://help.collab.land/marketplace/getting-started)

- Submit `action URL` form [link needed!] for review by CL DevRel

### Project Showcase - Miniapp Madness Demo Day

The Showcase event only happens once per month (3x/season) so if you are not ready for the current showcase, you can complete your project and be included in the next month's batch. Note: this process will evolve over time, the cadence will likely change.

:::info

Note: Your [two kinds of documentation](#ongoing-development--documentation) should already be drafted, reviewed, and feedback incorporated into final form before this point.

:::

- Sync event to present your completed Miniapp to the Collab.Land DAO for approval voting
- This event is an opportunity to market your Miniapp to community admins, so bring your best foot forward
  - memes, ideas, examples, documentation, etc.
  - Be prepared to answer questions run session(s) for your Miniapp
- Example [event agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRbN8-eBKH5lFCXOmju0kY_Y7nN7OSW7SZqBATToVgqSIeGr5KJwVGKQ2rA9Sct0uZbsDMXLnCK4G_o/pub)

### DAO Proposal

The Collab.Land team will sponsor your Miniapp for approval as a [DAO proposal](https://help.collab.land/governance/proposals). This process takes 14 days, following the [2/7/5 Proposal cycle](https://help.collab.land/governance/proposals#proposal-cycle).

If your Miniapp proposal passes, congratulations! You may now pay the Marketplace listing fee using Unlock Protocol. The Collab.Land will add your [documentation](#ongoing-development--documentation) to the Marketplace and activate your Miniapp for admins to install to their communities.
