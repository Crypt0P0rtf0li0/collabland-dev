CollabLand provides a set of REST APIs to discover tokenized communities, create
quests and drops, make transfers through payment channels.

The endpoints are served at https://api.collab.land and developers are
encouraged to [try them out](https://api.collab.land/explorer) now!

Are you ready? Let's launch the [CollabLand App](https://app.collab.land).
