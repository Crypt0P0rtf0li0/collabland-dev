# Terraform Access

Terraform is needed for E2E local development.

Services include the Job Queuing system & DynamoDB

To build the project locally youâ€™ll need to get access to the AWS sandbox environment.

The current process involves sending  your email address to the [Collab.Land](http://Collab.Land) team to have an AWS user profile added.  
This is because there are shared resources in the sandbox environment.

In the future the goal is to stand up all resources locally

1. 

```bash
Request your email be added via DM or though your verified communication channel 
with collab.land

Caleb from DevX will have the Tarmac Team add your email after verifying your
legitimacy
```
