# Tarmac Development Planning

Next steps:

- [ ]  1. Caleb will type up notes from our meeting about docker/ vs personsas and next steps
    - [ ]  New Chain
        - [ ]  New EVM
        - [ ]  
        - [ ]  Non EVM needs custom signature verification code
    - [ ]  New Wallet
        - [ ]  EVM wallet
            - [ ]  No backend changes, front end changes to wallet connect page only
        - [ ]  Tezos, Flow, Solana...
        - [ ]  Multichain wallet
        - [ ]  Single Chain New type ‚Äúinternet computer‚Äù
            - [ ]  Backend signature validation needed & front end wallet connection page changes
            - [ ]  To add new endpoint
                - [ ]  Showcase referece implementations like solana wallet verification (caleb just walked through this code solana/callback and could probably make a high level overview video of where this code lives & how to find this code in the front end & back end
                    - [ ]  **** TODO: Make a high level overview video in loom to point out this code
    - [ ]  
- [ ]  ***** 2. Caleb will make a diagram to showcase the different resources and user personas
    - [ ]  Use Draw .io
        - [ ]  Show internal resources
            - [ ]  Command Center  collabland-portal
            - [ ]  Wallet Connect Page  collabland-connect
            - [ ]  User settings site  collabland-???
            - [ ]  Backend  collabland-monorepo
                - [ ]  API server
                - [ ]  Job Server
                - [ ]  Discord Command Handlers
                - [ ]  Tarmac build defined in monorepo side branch branch: _______
        - [ ]  Show external resources
            - [ ]  Discord bot setup, discord server, etc
            - [ ]  AWS
                - [ ]  QA
                - [ ]  Development access to SQS, DynamoDB,
        - [ ]  Permissions
            - [ ]  Github Permissions
            - [ ]  Terraform AWS Users - Drop emails and they can be given user profiles
                - [ ]  *** Do this for 3 test devs emails are:
    - [ ]  2.5 Based on ^^ Diagram Create personas and say what repos they need access to, what services could be dockerized, what services need to be run locally and editable
        - [ ]  https://github.com/abridged/collabland-monorepo/issues/414
- [ ]  3. We can begin to discuss dockerizing any resources a persona will need to use without editing
- [ ]  4. Caleb will help the hackathon team get their local env running & document any trouble shooting in notion -> Eventually to be moved to DEVELOPER.md in each project
    - [ ]  For each repo have a [DEVELPER.md](http://DEVELPER.md) that teaches developers how to get started, apparently [README.md](http://README.md) is supposed to be for users - the difference being that users dont want to change the code they just want to take advantage of the existing functionality?
- [ ]  5. Caleb is still working to get the command center to build locally, once that‚Äôs built he will start to walk the 3rd party devs through how to set up the entire local stack including aws ‚ÄúUSERS‚Äù by providing their email to tarmac so they can receive credientals.
- [ ]  6. We will continue to itterate forward
- [ ]  Please let me know if you need any unblocking for Palumi (Spelling?)
- [ ]  My greatest strength is my fresh eyes and trying to push other developers though this stack - aka my ignorance üôÇ
- [ ]  7. I think we had also discussed a follow up meeting for future ‚Äúideal‚Äù changes for how developers cna run the whole stack localy, for how github actions will kick off a fixed number of AWS actions, etc.
- [ ]  Conclusion:
- [ ]  1. Cant easily edit within docker so not the perfect solution for the challenges I‚Äùm facing while onboarding devs.
- [ ]  I will put these notes somehwere more perminent
