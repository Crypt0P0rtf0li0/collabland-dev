## What is the Collab.Land DAO?

The Collab.Land DAO (legal entity: Collab.Land Co-op) is focused on building a trusted ecosystem to enable greater value-alignment and cooperation within web3 projects. Bringing together thousands of different communities under one roof and allowing them to work together to identify and build the most effective tools to coordinate.

The DAO is made up of the community of COLLAB token holders. Any token holder is welcome to join the Discord and verify their membership with the Collab.Land bot.

The work of the Collab.Land Co-op happens in different ways. One of the DAOâ€™s primary functions is to oversee the Collab.Land Marketplace. DAO members will curate and review new apps submitted to the Marketplace and make other governance decisions.
