## Who is eligible to claim the token?

The following four groups are eligible for a sponsored claim. A sponsored claim means that Collab.Land is not requiring claimants to pay gas. This also means that no wallet connection is required.
Tokens can be claimed starting on February 23, 2023 until May 23, 2023.

1. Community Members 
2. Collab.Land’s Top 100 Discord communities
3. Collab.Land Patron NFT holders 
4. Collab.Land Membership NFT holders

### Community Members

Members who have verified their wallet with a community managed by the Collab.Land bot before the snapshot (Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST) are eligible to claim 10 tokens.

#### Discord 

Discord Community Members must have verified at least one wallet with the Collab.Land bot before the snapshot date (Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST) to be eligible to claim $COLLAB tokens. Community Members are eligible to claim 10 tokens.

#### Telegram 

Telegram Community Members must have verified at least one wallet with the Collab.Land bot before the snapshot date (Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST) to be eligible to claim $COLLAB tokens. Community Members are eligible to claim 10 tokens.

### Top 100 Communities

In order to claim tokens, each of the Top 100 communities must go through the Community Claim Process. The goal is to propose a unique and creative mechanism for how they will use and/or distribute the tokens. Top 100 communities can learn more [below](top-100/overview)

We encourage all Top 100 communities that have been allocated COLLAB tokens to begin discussions with the core team via the [Collab.Land Discord](http://discord.gg/collabland).


### Membership NFT holders

Members who hold the Membership NFT with token ID 0 - 28313 (snapshot taken Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST) are eligible to claim 1,412 $COLLAB tokens per Membership NFT.

#### Troubleshooting Membership NFT claim

If you hold a qualifying Membership NFT, if it is still eligible to be claimed: https://wagmi.collab.land/eligibility and the claim site shows that you are not eligible for Membership NFT tokens, follow these troubleshooting steps:

- Re-verify the wallet that holds the Membership NFT with the Collab.Land bot
- Join the Collab.Land Discord https://discord.com/invite/collabland
- Click “Let’s go!” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Click “Connect Wallet” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Verify the wallet address that holds your Membership NFT
- Claim tokens from Membership NFT on claim site https://wagmi.collab.land


### Patreon NFT holders

Members who hold the Patron NFT with token ID 0 - 141 (snapshot taken Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST) are eligible to claim 281,690 $COLLAB tokens per Patron NFT.

#### Troubleshooting Patron NFT claim

If you hold a qualifying Patron NFT, if it is still eligible to be claimed: https://wagmi.collab.land/eligibility and the claim site shows that you are not eligible for Patron NFT tokens, follow these troubleshooting steps.

- Re-verify the wallet that holds the Membership NFT with the Collab.Land bot
- Join the Collab.Land Discord https://discord.com/invite/collabland
- Click “Let’s go!” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Click “Connect Wallet” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Verify the wallet address that holds your Patron NFT
- Claim tokens from Patron NFT on claim site https://wagmi.collab.land

#### Both Patron & Membership NFT holders:

Patron NFTs with token ID 0 - 141 are eligible to claim 281,690 $COLLAB tokens per Patron NFT and Membership NFTs with token ID 0 - 28313 are eligible to claim 1,412 $COLLAB tokens per Membership NFT. Snapshots for both NFT types were taken Feb 14, 2023 at 12pm PST. Members may hold Patron & Membership NFTs in the same wallet or in separate wallets.

##### Patron & Membership NFTs in the same wallet

If the claim site shows that you don’t qualify for the tokens for both of these NFTs, re-verify the wallet that holds the NFTs with the Collab.Land bot. In order to do that, follow these steps:

- Join the Collab.Land Discord https://discord.com/invite/collabland
- Click “Let’s go!” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Click “Connect Wallet” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Verify the wallet address that holds your Patron NFT
- Claim tokens from NFTs on claim site https://wagmi.collab.land

##### Patron & Membership NFTs in different wallets

Currently, the Collab.Land bot allows only 1 EVM wallet connection per community at a time. But Members can go through the claim flow multiple times if they have qualified claims to unclaimed tokens.

This means that you will need to separate your connections, either to different communities or go through the token claim flow multiple times after switching which wallet is connected with the Collab.Land bot. 

First claim the tokens associated with one NFT type, then change your Collab.Land-verified wallet to the one that holds the other NFT type and finally claim those other tokens. In order to do so, follow these steps:

- Join the Collab.Land Discord https://discord.com/invite/collabland
- Click “Let’s go!” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Click “Connect Wallet” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Verify the wallet address that holds your Patron NFT
- Claim tokens from Patron NFT on claim site https://wagmi.collab.land/ (Switch Collab.Land-verified wallets + claim again)
- Click “Let’s go!” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Click “Connect Wallet” button in the #collabland-join channel
- Verify the wallet address that holds your Membership NFT
- Claim tokens from Membership NFT on claim site https://wagmi.collab.land/

##### Troubleshooting:

- Ensure you have logged in using the correct Discord account, we cannot verify any token claims without having the correct Discord account connected.
- Members can go through the claim flow multiple times if they have qualified claims to unclaimed tokens.
- You can only claim once for each Patron and Membership NFT token ID. 
    - To check the eligibility of an NFT token ID, please go to: https://wagmi.collab.land/eligibility
- Tokens can be claimed to any EVM wallet address. It does not have to be a wallet address verified with  Collab.Land. You will just need to input the wallet address, no need to connect.
- Claim is gas-free for members and is sponsored by Collab.Land
- If you get a “Duplicate Wallet” error, please read: https://help.collab.land/wallets/duplicate-wallet
